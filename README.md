# Setting Up GitLab Runners: Local Windows & AWS EC2
A documentation of my journey setting up GitLab runners in different environments.

## üìù Overview
I configured two GitLab runners:
- A local runner on my Windows machine
- A runner on an AWS EC2 Linux instance


## Windows Local Runner Setup - https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/windows/
1. Created a folder called `GitLab-Runner` on my `C:\` drive.

2. Downloaded the 64-bit binary which contains the gitlab-runner.exe and moved it to the folder called `GitLab-Runner` on my `C:\` drive.

3. Ran the below commands in Powershell in the GitLab-Runner folder to install, start, and check the status of the runner:

`.\gitlab-runner install`
`.\gitlab-runner start`
`.\gitlab-runner status`

2. Registered the runner with my GitLab instance (gitlab.com)

I used the `.\gitlab-runner register` command and provided the required information:

3. Verified my runner appears in GitLab's runner list

## ‚òÅÔ∏è AWS EC2 Runner Setup
1. Created an EC2 instance using Ubuntu AMI

2. Installed and configured GitLab Runner using Docker executor

Followed the steps - https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/linux-repository/
